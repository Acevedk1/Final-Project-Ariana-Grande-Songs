# Final-Project-Ariana-Grande-Songs
Final project where I studied the relationship between Ariana grande songs and its variables.
To access and utilize the script, open the "Acevedo.R" file, which contains the code for my findings. To acess the data set, open the "Final_Project-Sheet1-3.csv" file.

##**Data**
The data used for the analyses was a sample of all of ariana grande's songs. The question being asked was if there is a relationship or a common theme in her songs whether it is when the song came out, how long it was, the vibe/mood the song gives, or if the song featured another artists. Each unit of analysis one song and in total it was 30 different songs. The type of sampling strategy that was used was convenience sampling. 

I gathered the data by listing all of the songs that Ariana Grande has released and from the population I selected songs randomly and came up with variables that interested me.

##**Operationalization**
The concept of mood of the song was operationalized by using a qualitative coding scheme using 5 different moods.
