To access and utilize the script, open the "Acevedo.R" file, which contains the code for my findings. To acess the data set, open the "Final_Project-Sheet1-5.csv" file.

##**Data**

The data used for the analyses was a sample of all of ariana grande's songs. The question being asked was if there is a relationship or a common theme in her songs whether it is when the song came out, how long it was, the vibe/mood the song gives, or if the song featured another artists. Each unit of analysis one song and in total it was 30 different songs. The type of sampling strategy that was used was convenience sampling. 

I gathered the data by listing all of the songs that Ariana Grande has released and from the population I selected songs randomly and came up with variables that interested me.

##**Operationalization**

The concept of mood of the song was operationalized by using a qualitative coding scheme using 5 different moods. Happiness,Angry,Sad,Hopeful,or love. If the song lyrics spoke about the future and change then I put it under hopeful, if it was about love or to a significant other I put it under love, if it was about living her best life and being in a better place I put it under happiness, and if it was about heartbreak or feeling down I put it under sad, and lastly if it was giving a I do not want anything to do with you vibe I put it under angry.

The concept of feature in a song was operationalized by using a qualitative coding scheme of yes or not. This was is more simple if the song featured another artist it was under "yes" and if it did not it put under "no".

The concept of how long the song was is operationalized through a quantitative variable named song_length, where songs were measured by seconds in length. It if it was 3 minutes it converted into 180. 

The concepts of how long ago the song came out is operationalized through a quantitative variable named "release". This was measured by year of release, after selecting my sample I went through every song and searched when it came out.
